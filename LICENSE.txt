The "PlantStudio" name itself is a trademark of Cynthia F. Kurtz and Paul D. Fernhout.
Basically, similar to with the "Linux" trademork,
  http://www.linuxfoundation.org/programs/legal/trademark
if you make useful derivatives of the code under the GPL about 3D models of plants and similar things,
and true to the purpose of openness and sharing as we see it, and with proper attribution as to the origins
of the software, we will permit you to use the trademark. Otherwise we will request you to change
the name of the software you distribute to avoid confusion.
